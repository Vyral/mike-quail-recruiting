<p>If you’re reading this, you are probably working at a real estate brokerage and doing between 4 and 30 transactions per year.</p>

<p>Let me make a few guesses about your current circumstances:</p>

<p>If you’re already an agent, you probably aren’t getting the support that you need in order to advance your career. Many brokerages don’t offer the leads, training, coaching, accountability, or structure required to succeed in this business.</p>

<p>In fact, <strong>80% of real estate agents will fail to achieve the level of success they want and leave the industry within their first two years.</strong> Agents don’t leave the industry because they made too much money. They leave because they didn’t make any. Many agents are not prepared to run a real estate business and have the initial starting capital of just three months’ worth of expenses.</p>

<p>You might long for a kind of lifestyle that your current job can’t afford you—the freedom to maintain your life outside of work as you please, the money to support your family as well as your personal goals, and the time to make all of it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re kept awake at night because you can’t guarantee where your next check will come from, you probably long for the weight of looming bills and the threat of bankruptcy to leave your shoulders. You’re spending money on leads and marketing platforms, but the expenses are piling up. You yearn for guidance about what to do next, and when to do it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve already sought out a solution to these problems. There are numerous companies out there that promise to deliver quality leads that you can convert into clients, therefore allowing you to grow in your business and personal life. <strong>The trouble is, many of these are merely marketing mirages designed only to recruit you, not to nurture your professional and personal interests.</strong></p>

<p>You might focus your attention on whether a brokerage offers a high split, but you should know that those don’t provide you with the highest value or the coaching you actually need. Many brokerages spend all day recruiting when they should be spending that time training you to be successful.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, here’s the thing: If you don’t do something different with your career, you’ll probably wind up in that dreaded 80% of the industry—admitting defeat and leaving real estate forever. You’ll go back to a regular 9-to-5 job, forego the comfortable lifestyle you always dreamed of, and re-enter the cycle of making ends meet.</p>

<p>But don’t let your frustrations, anxieties, and past misfortunes get you down. <strong>There is a solution to your problems, and it doesn’t involve letting the real estate business chew you up and spit you out:</strong></p>

<p>I’d like to invite you in for a discussion about becoming a member of our brokerage.</p>

<p>As you probably know, I am an untraditional team leader constantly finding myself in need of competent real estate agents to help me with my ever growing real estate business.</p>

<p>Over the last 15 years, I have sold over 500 homes and as a result been able to develop and implement many unique Consumer Programs. These consumer programs allow me to generate an overflow of fantastic buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>And this is where you come in.</p>

<p>I am willing to guarantee you as many as you can skillfully handle, buyers and sellers that want to move, can move and will move.</p>

<p>These buyers and sellers are not your average prospect.  They are most likely the kind you long for each day.  For one thing, they are buying or selling at 20% above the market area price average, And since our clients pay us a 27% higher commission than what the average agent gets, you are guaranteed to make way more money than you are right now on each and every transaction. So let me be clear here, qualified buyers and sellers, at a higher price point average, pay a higher commission on each transaction, given to you on a silver platter.</p>

<p>I am confident you will be amazed at the sheer number of buyers and sellers contacting us each day and blown away by the quality of these prospects.</p>

<p>Here are a few facts you should know about my sales team.  Outside of getting as many high quality buyers and sellers as we can skillfully handle, we do no cold calling or manual grunt prospecting.   All of the buyers and sellers, 100% of them, contact us. In fact if you accept my offer to come to this special presentation you will see this ‘reverse prospecting system’ at work.</p>

<p>You may have heard claims from other people talking about leads and you getting leads.  But what I want you to know is that the buyers and sellers you will get here are the same kinds of buyers and sellers that I work with.  There’s just way more than me or my selling partners can get to.  Surely you know that it would be impossible for my team to sell hundreds of homes a year working with poor and low quality buyers and sellers.  But again, don’t take my word for it.  Come and come and talk with me for yourself, without any obligation.</p>

<p>The only thing I ask is that you be a success minded agent who prefers spending your time selling homes instead of chasing down prospects.  Think about that for a moment.  The agents on my team don’t worry about where their next closing will come from because all of the great buyers and sellers are flowing into them directly. The Agents on my team I call selling partners love this career move because they only do the parts of the job they like.  We have exclusive systems and assistants to handle the other parts of the job so they spend their time actually selling homes vs doing admin tasks.</p>

<p>As you may have heard from some of the agents on my team, the training allows them to get face to face with more prospects, use specialized and exclusive presentations to not just get more clients to sign listing agreements and buyer agreements, but get a higher than average commissions. And deliver better service and results.  This training is what I call Millionaire Agent Maker Training, it's ongoing and is superior to the kinds of training offered by the traditional real estate industry.  It's really hard to fail here, in fact everyone makes more money than they ever thought they could selling real estate.  What would incomes of $100,000 to $250,000 a year do for your life?  What would a real estate career, spent only doing the parts of the job you like, just working with sincere motivated buyers and sellers, do for your joy level and personal satisfaction each day?  If you are the kind of agent I think you are, then what I am describing here excites you.  Again, don’t take my word for it, come and see for yourself how it all works.</p>

<p>I promise you that your time will not be wasted and I will hold nothing back in showing you the quantity and quality of the buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>If you take me up on my offer to explore whether our team is right for you, I’d be glad to show you that we’re not all just talk—we can prove that what we say actually happens.</p>

<p>If you will leave me your name, email address and phone number, we will send you a time to connect. I would strongly suggest you not procrastinate or dismiss this opportunity.  Even though we have more buyers and sellers than we can get to right now, we like it that way.  So I am only looking for a couple of success minded agents to help us with the overflow of clients.</p>

<p>Then again, you could also elect to go a different route. But I’ll warn you: Other solo agent big-box brokerages often foster a dog-eat-dog atmosphere in which you’re technically a part of the brand, but still left to succeed (or fail) on your own. Many will spend a lot of their time calling or texting you so they can recruit you, but once you’re there, they don’t provide the resources you need to grow your business. Others still will promise you quality leads but, in reality, will provide you with weak Facebook leads from people who aren’t really interested in buying or selling homes and they won’t hold you to the same productivity and educational standards that we will.</p>

<p>The choice is yours: <strong>Face an uncertain industry full of mirages and false promises on your own—or become an agent with our brokerage, consistently netting a strong salary while maintaining a lifestyle fit for you and your family.</strong></p>

<p>If your interest has been piqued, I do urge you to act quickly. The popular real estate service Redfin is gearing up for a massive advertising campaign across the USA to offer clients a low-commission environment. If you don’t have your business system in place before then, you’ll get crushed.</p>

<p>Let’s get together now so we can make sure you succeed in real estate regardless of what happens next.</p>

<p>I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

<p>Mike Quail</p>
