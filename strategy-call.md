<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<!-- {% include strategy-photos.html %} -->

<p>My name is Mike Quail and I’ve sold 75 of homes to date.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"The whole session was great. Really helpful. It's always nice to see what another agent, let alone another team, does. This has been extremely helpful. I'd definitely love to be included on the follow up. I think, definitely, especially in this slowing down time, we've still been pretty busy. It's nice to be able to have some takeaways to really focus and structure our business plan and get centered, and not get carried away with the shifts that have happened. Letting Matt and I make some thoughtful implementations into our business and not just run wild with it." <span class="testimonial-author">- Shea Pillsbury, Keller Williams Beverly</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">""Lucky; Very Helpful! Mike went through everything other than just leads. He took us through a whole system other than just taking a course to learn one part of the business. The biggest take away from this is that I was the importance of domains. For a domain where I want to send my CRM, making sure that the area is in the title is very smart. If I am searching for Northshore homes, and I see Mike Quail,  I might click on it. But if I see a site with Northshore Homes in the title, I definitely would click on it because that website obviously has what I want."" <span class="testimonial-author">- Lucky Henry, Keller Williams Boston</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Thank you very much. This was right on time. With all this time, this was great, to get myself situated. Also, all the resources that I can now leverage and I can now see, it was driving me crazy to find something. Thank you very much, and  I will be contacting you." <span class="testimonial-author">- Walguira Leguisamon, Keller Williams Reading</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"You've given me guidance. You're keeping positive. 'Colleen, you  just started but you can get through this,' And I think I have contacted three buyers this week! So, I think that is huge in these times. You've just taught me a lot. How to reach out to people, and structure, during these difficult times.  <span class="testimonial-author">- Colleen Eddy, eXp Realty Danvers</span></p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
