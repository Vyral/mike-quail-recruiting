*New to the real estate business? I’ll show you how to make a six-figure income in your first year.*

So, you’ve recently earned your real estate license, and maybe you haven’t done much with it yet—how do you make money? A lot of people get into the industry because they have a big heart and love to serve people. This is an incredible business for that; you can help families buy and sell homes and move on to the next phase of their lives. However, what you might not realize is that this isn’t just a ‘heart’ business—it’s a fast-paced industry that relies on marketing, self-promotion, and cold calling. If you don’t do those three things, you’ll often find yourself struggling.

That’s why 95% of the agents who joined the industry this year won’t be in it three years from now. The brokers in this business are aware of this harsh statistical reality, which is why they hire as many agents as they can and just hope that a few good ones will stick. When you join a brokerage, they don’t give you any money to succeed—it’s all on you.

So how can you be successful and make six figures in your first year?
