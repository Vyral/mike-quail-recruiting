<p style="text-align:center;"><em>What’s the trick to staying top of mind without coming off as cheesy?</em></p>

Today I’ll share the secret to getting tons of referrals from your friends, family, and past clients without being cheesy or begging for business.

Here at the Mike Quail Team, we’ve partnered with the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and the Jimmy Fund to help people conquer cancer. To do that, we’ve set a team goal to donate $10,000 to the Jimmy Fund.

To accomplish that goal, **we update all our past clients, friends, and family once a month on our progress with the goal via newsletter.** It’s a four-page, full-color brochure that includes information about what’s happening in the market, what our team has been working on, and how much progress we’ve made with our donation. We also highlight a particular patient’s story each month.

The typical real estate newsletter has things like pumpkin pie recipes and gardening tips, which are all fine, but they don’t really move the client. If you plan to make your own newsletter, pick a worthy cause that you’re passionate about and invest in it both monetarily and emotionally. The newsletter will cost money, so you might need to hire a virtual assistant to help you put it together.

Beyond keeping your sphere of influence updated on what you’ve been doing and supporting a great cause, **it will also help keep your name top of mind when they consider hiring a real estate team to assist them.**

If you have any further questions about how to put this worthy cause newsletter together or if you’re looking to expand your career by joining our team, reach out to me for a confidential conversation. Hope to hear from you soon\!
