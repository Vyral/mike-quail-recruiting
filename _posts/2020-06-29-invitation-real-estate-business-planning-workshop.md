**Boston Area Real Estate Agent Business Planning Workshop**

I’d like to invite you to my 3-hour Real Estate Business Planning workshop.

You’ll leave with a business plan that has the exact steps needed to sell homes right now – even with the ongoing pandemic.

Yes, you should continue to market to your sphere, past clients, nurtures, and existing relationships by staying in better touch with timely guidance and advice. BUT, you also need to learn how to attract new business that will be motivated to buy and sell homes now.

Sign up **[here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/boston-area-real-estate-agent-business-planning-workshop-tickets-102109163256){: target="_blank"}**\!
