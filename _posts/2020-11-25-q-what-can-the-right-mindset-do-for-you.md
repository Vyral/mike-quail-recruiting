<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Our newest agent booked 16 appointments in three weeks. Here’s how.</em></p>

Amy has been with the Mike Quail Home Selling Team for just three weeks, and she’s already booked 16 appointments. Of those 16 appointments, she’s met with six potential clients and signed all of them to year-long buyer agreements at a 3% commission.&nbsp;

How did she do it? What kind of mental habits has she employed to hit the ground running?

In her words, **she’s been 100% committed to coming in to the office every day to make her calls, stick to the scripts, and have a good attitude.** When you’re positive with people over the phone, it draws them in and gets the conversation going. We generate as many as 400 new leads a month into our website. Some of those people want to talk to us, others don’t. It’s our job as agents to reach out to them, find out who’s worth talking to, and who wants to make a move.&nbsp;

Amy’s mindset toward those who aren’t so friendly is to simply be nice to them and change their day so they change their mind and want to have a conversation. This is key because, as I alluded to above, some internet leads develop into great clients, while others might hang up on you. You never know which way things will go. We refer to this as “separating the treasure from the trash.”

**After experiencing a bad call, one of the bad habits an agent can fall into is assuming every call after that will be bad too.** To Amy, every call is new and different, and she mentally starts over after each one ends. We have thousands of leads at our disposal, so if someone doesn’t want to talk to us about real estate, we wish them well and move on to the next name. The great leads, on the other hand, just want to have a conversation and tell you what they’re looking for.&nbsp;

Amy also uses an agent scorecard to track her calls (she shoots for about 100 per day), showings, appointments, and who she might sign during one of those appointments. She likes it because it tracks her success and keeps her accountable. I occasionally use one of these scorecards myself when I make calls to track my effort and successes.&nbsp;

In addition to focusing on the right mindset, we do a lot more for our agents. In her time with us, for example, we’ve taught Amy quick, efficient scripts and provided objection handlers, although we don’t like to twist people’s arms too much. We always try to be open and friendly, and we never try forcing someone into a deal.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about developing the right kinds of habits as an agent or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you. Until then, happy selling\!
