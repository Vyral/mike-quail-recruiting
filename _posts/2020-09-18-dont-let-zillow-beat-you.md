Here’s how real estate agents can ensure Zillow doesn’t beat them.

Zillow is a huge player in the real estate industry. So as a real estate agent, how do you beat Zillow?&nbsp;

**I don’t think there’s a true way to “beat” Zillow.** I recommend bringing Zillow into the conversation. When discussing home values with your seller, bring your laptop or a screenshot of their Zestimate. You know your seller has checked Zillow, so instead of ignoring it like the elephant in the room, talk about it.&nbsp;

Zillow’s Zestimates can be too low, too high, or accurate, which means we don’t truly know what a home is worth until we look at comparable properties. (If you don’t know how to find comparables, reach out to me; I can help you.) I always explain to my sellers that the Zestimate is not very accurate, tell them we need to look at the last 90 or 180 days of sales of comparable homes, and we’ll go through them together.&nbsp;

**Show your sellers that you can give them a more accurate valuation** than an online estimation can. This is how to bring Zillow into the conversation and not let it beat you.&nbsp;

If you have questions about Zestimates or real estate in general, reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.
