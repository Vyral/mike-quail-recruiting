<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in {{site.data.settings.client.market}}?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you. These include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 28,824 homes sold in the greater Boston market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 75 homes last year and our average agent earns six figures a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"The whole session was great. Really helpful. It's always nice to see what another agent, let alone another team, does. This has been extremely helpful. I'd definitely love to be included on the follow up. I think, definitely, especially in this slowing down time, we've still been pretty busy. It's nice to be able to have some takeaways to really focus and structure our business plan and get centered, and not get carried away with the shifts that have happened. Letting Matt and I make some thoughtful implementations into our business and not just run wild with it." <span class="testimonial-author">- Shea Pillsbury, Keller Williams Beverly</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">""Lucky; Very Helpful! Mike went through everything other than just leads. He took us through a whole system other than just taking a course to learn one part of the business. The biggest take away from this is that I was the importance of domains. For a domain where I want to send my CRM, making sure that the area is in the title is very smart. If I am searching for Northshore homes, and I see Mike Quail,  I might click on it. But if I see a site with Northshore Homes in the title, I definitely would click on it because that website obviously has what I want."" <span class="testimonial-author">- Lucky Henry, Keller Williams Boston</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Thank you very much. This was right on time. With all this time, this was great, to get myself situated. Also, all the resources that I can now leverage and I can now see, it was driving me crazy to find something. Thank you very much, and  I will be contacting you." <span class="testimonial-author">- Walguira Leguisamon, Keller Williams Reading</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"You've given me guidance. You're keeping positive. 'Colleen, you  just started but you can get through this,' And I think I have contacted three buyers this week! So, I think that is huge in these times. You've just taught me a lot. How to reach out to people, and structure, during these difficult times.  <span class="testimonial-author">- Colleen Eddy, eXp Realty Danvers</span></p>
